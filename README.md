# Code for Bachelor Thesis morphodynamic equilibria 2D double inlet system
This repository is for the code I used during my bachelor thesis. 

Welcome, My name is Billy Verhage. 
This project was to fulfil my double bachelor's degree, Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology. 
I was supervised by: Prof. Dr H. M. Schuttelaars and Dr. S. R. de Roode. 
During this project, I simulated the equilibria of two-dimensional double inlet systems. For more information, I will refer to my thesis. 

The structure of this repository:
- Outdated_code Folder: contains out_dated code that I did not want to delete yet.
- Structured Folder: contains the code I used to create the results shown in my thesis.
- Supplements Folder: contains non-code related supplements like my thesis.

Heads up I am very dyslectic and I do not know the existence of spell checkers on code editors.   

If anybody is intrested in my code please send me a message and I will create meaninfull comments. 
So is anything is unclear feel free to message me about it and also feel free to use or improve my code.

With Kind Regards,
Billy Verhage

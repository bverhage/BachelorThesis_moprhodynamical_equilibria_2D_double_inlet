# The code
You have made it to my code!

The file named OuterShell.py is the shell that runs the Newton-Rapsons method. To do this it calls the following files:
- Model_Numerical_Jacobian_total_model.py 
- Model_parameters.py
- Model_functions.py

This code is created in Python 3.7.3. 

I used the following modules
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- tqdm

# The code
You have made it to my code!

I tried to tidy everything up. But my experiments stopped working so for laziness sake it is still a mess.

---	
To create the plots in chapter 5.2 the normal shell was used. To runn this please runn the file 'OuterShell.py'. It runs the Newton-Rapsons method described in te method. 
To do this it calls the following files:
- Model_Numerical_Jacobian_total_model.py 
- Model_parameters.py
- Model_functions.py

This code is created in Python 3.7.3. 

I used the following modules
- NumPy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- tqdm

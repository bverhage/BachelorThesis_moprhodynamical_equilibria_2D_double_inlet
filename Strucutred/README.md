# The code
You have made it to my code!

I tried to tidy everything up. But my experiments stopped working so for laziness sake it is still a mess.

A normal runn of the code is done with the file called OuterShell.py. It runs the Newton-Rapsons method. 
To do this it calls the following files:
- Model_Numerical_Jacobian_total_model.py 
- Model_parameters.py
- Model_functions.py

This code is created in Python 3.7.3. 

I used the following modules
- NumPy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- tqdm
